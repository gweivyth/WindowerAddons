A small addon I wrote while doing Magian Trials for myself.  It isn't very complex at the moment, it is a work in progress (at least until I finish my Masamune...)



Commands:

//nmtracker or //nmt

//nmt start [name] [timer(in seconds)] [Optional party message] - Set a timer.  If no message is defined, will use default message.  Can be used to add <-calls#-> to alert yourself.

//nmt restart - Repeats the last set timer.

//nmt delete [name] - Deletes the named timer.

//nmt toggle - Toggles the addon between taking input in seconds or minutes.  Useful if you don't feel like doing the conversion in your head.  Default is seconds.  Uses the config addon to retain the toggle between loads.
