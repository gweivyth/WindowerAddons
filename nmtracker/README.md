A small addon I wrote while doing Magian Trials for myself.  It isn't very complex at the moment, it is a work in progress (at least until I finish my Masamune...)



Commands:

//nmtracker or //nmt

//nmt start [name] [timer(in seconds)] [Optional party message] - Set a timer.  If no message is defined, will use default message.  Can be used to add <calls> to alert yourself.

//nmt restart - Repeats the last set timer.

//nmt delete [name] - Deletes the named timer.
